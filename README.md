# algebra-lab

A tiny pure-Python algebra library for univariate polynomials.

- Dense coefficient representation (coeffs[i] is the coefficient of x**i)
- Operator overloading: +, -, *, **, divmod, //, %, evaluation via p(x)
- Calculus: derivative and antiderivative (with initial condition)
- Manual convolution for multiplication (no NumPy dependency)
- Fully tested with pytest and type-checked with mypy
